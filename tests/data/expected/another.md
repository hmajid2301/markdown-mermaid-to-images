In this article, I will show you how can automate the publishing of your
AAB/APK to the `Google Play Console`. We will be using the [Gradle Play
Publisher](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher) (GPP)
plugin to do automate this process for us. Using this plugin we cannot
only automate the publishing and release of our app, we can also update
the release notes, store listing (including photos) all from GitLab CI.

**Note:** In this article I will assume that you are using Linux and
React Native version \>= 0.60.
